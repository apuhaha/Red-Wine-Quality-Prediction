# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
### About
  The red wine industry shows a recent exponential growth as social drinking is on the rise. Nowadays, industry players are using product quality certifications to promote their products. This is a time-consuming process and requires the assessment given by human experts, which makes this process very expensive.
 
  Also, the price of red wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters, opinions among whom may have a high degree of variability. Another vital factor in red wine certification and quality assessment is physicochemical tests, which are laboratory-based and consider factors like acidity, pHlevel, sugar, and other chemical properties. The red wine market would be of interest if the human quality of tasting can be related to wine’s chemical properties so that certification and quality assessment and assurance processes are more controlled.
  
AIM:
        The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the given datset, and classify the data according to quality.
       
### Dataset:
   The dataset has attribute columns that determine the risk of having cervical cancer. The dataset has 1599 rows and 12 columns.
The columns in the dataset are-
 * ‘Fixed acidity'
 * 'Volatile acidity'
 * 'Citric acid'
 * 'Residual sugar'
 * 'Chlorides'
 * 'Free sulfur dioxide'
 * 'Total sulfur dioxide'
 * 'Density'
 * 'pH'
 * 'Sulphates'
 * 'Alcohol'
 * 'Quality’ 

The data had 240 duplicate entries, which were removed. The data had several outliers, which could have interfered with the outcoms, hence were dropped from the dataset.
Then this new dataset was used to perform data analysis on it, by segmenting the quality row into two categories- fine wine and bad wine.

###CONCLUSION:
* After the analysis of the data, following inferences were drawn-
* Around 0.3 units citric acid is present in fine quality wine.
* Fine quality wine has free sulfur dioxide upto 14 units.
* The pH of fine quality wine ranges from 3 to 3.6 units.
* For fine quality wine, residual sugar should be low, around 1-3 units.
* More the volatile acidity, lower the wine quality.
